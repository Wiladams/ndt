This is a collection of little Desktop Actions (d-action).  Just little programs that are easy to
code, easy to play with.  A little distraction while you work.

Part of d-action is to find out what the program does.  In many cases, you play around by moving
the mouse or pressing some keys on the keyboard.

Some Keyboard Hints
===================
In some cases, pressing the [Space] bar will change modes
In some cases, pressing [Esc] will change modes, or close the program
In some cases, pressing [UP][DOWN] arrow keys will do something interesting

Sometimes action just occurs on its own and there's nothing for you to do
but watch, or is there...

timeflies
=========
Story: 
------
    We never have enough time.  timeflies puts an analog clock on your
    screen.  In fact, you can put as many clocks as you like on the screen.
    As you add clocks, they show up in random places, and are random sizes.
    Time is restless though, never standing still.  It won't be long before
    time wants to have fun and decides to fly off in some random direction.
    
    You can still do your work as time won't interfere with you active window.  Even so, you if you want to move them out of the way, you can click the mouse within the white area at their center.  Be careful though, if you drag the clock around for too long, the center will shrink, and you will be
    able to control time.

Controls:
---------
    [Click] - click anywhere on any clock to bring them to the forefront
    [UP] - Add more clocks
    [DOWN] - Remove clocks.  There will always be at least one
    [ESC]   To quit time.  You must have clicked on at least one clock
            to bring them to the forefront before you can click.  


wavemaker - move mouse around, watch pretty patterns

These dactions were created using a programming environment called 'ndt', which can be found here:

https://github.com/wiladams/ndt

The environment is meant to be used as part of a programming educational curriculum.  Otherwise, these are just fun little programs to play with.
